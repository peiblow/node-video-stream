### Hi, this is my nodeJs video editor using node streams and the libraly ffmpeg.

. Its too simple to use, first of all add your video on the assets folder and run the command below on your terminal.

```
npm run prepare-video
```

The command will generate a video output and above this output we'll made our edit.

To see the result just run the commands below

```
npm run web
npm run start
```

And access the url **localhost:8081**
